A datate set contained in the file p_dataset_26.zip is provided on CANVAS. 
Divide this dataset into two portions: (a) a 75% portion that will be used as the training set, and (b) the remaining 25% portion as the validation (testing) set. Use these two subdatasets to complete the following three sub-tasks:
Sub-task 1: Create a CNN to classify each character in the second line in Image 1, i.e., HD44780A00in image 1.
Sub-task 2: Create a classification system, using a non-CNN-based method (or a combination of such methods) selected from those methods that have been covered in Part 2 of this module, to classify each character in the second line in Image 1, i.e., HD44780A00.
Sub-task 3: Report the results obtained from Sub-task 1 and Sub-task 2, and compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the two approaches (i.e., one uses a CNN, the other does not). Provide your own explanation on any differences in the results between these two approaches.
Note: Do not use the characters in Image 1 as training data for your classifier.
8. Throughout step 7 (training of the classifier), also experiment with pre-processing of the data (e.g., padding/resizing input images) as well as with hyperparameter tuning. In your report, discuss how sensitive your approach is to these changes.
